This repository was created to host all the codefiles for the HDSC Winter '22 capstone project.<br>
By team XGBoost

The complete, initial datasets can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedlahlou/accidents-in-france-from-2005-to-2016<br>
However, datasets.zip contains all the datasets required to run the individual notebooks without having to start from scratch
